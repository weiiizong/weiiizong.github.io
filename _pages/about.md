Hi, I'm Wei Zong. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh in 2023, under the mentorship of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/). During my doctoral studies, I also worked as a graduate student researcher with [Dr. Colleen McClung](http://www.mcclung.pitt.edu/) at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh. Prior to my PhD, I completed an MASt in Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge. 

My research lies at the intersection of statistical methodology and its interdisciplinary applications in
biomedical research, with a broad goal of advancing health data science. I am particularly interested in developing statistical models for high-dimensional data to support informed decision-making from large-scale datasets. On the application side, I collaborated with researchers in psychiatry to analyze a wide range of omics and clinical data.
