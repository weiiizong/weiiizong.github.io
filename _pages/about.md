I am a 5th year PhD student at [George Tseng's Lab](http://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu/index.htm), Department of Biostatistics,University of Pittsburgh supervised by [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/). I am also a graduate student researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Colleen McClung](http://www.mcclung.pitt.edu/) at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh. I received my MASt in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Cambridge in 2017.

My research interest lies in the intersection between statistical methodology and its applications to genomics and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in statistical modeling of high‑dimensional data, Bayesian modeling, cross‑species congruence evaluation and circadian analysis. In addition to methodology development, I have also been collaborating with researchers in the field of psychiatry and helped analyze a broad range of genomic data
(e.g. gene expression data from microarray and RNA-seq platforms, mass spectrometry based proteomic data, etc.) and clinical data.
